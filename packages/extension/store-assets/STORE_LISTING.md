## Title
SkillKit - Save as Skill

## Summary (132 chars max)
Save any webpage as an AI agent skill file. One click, works across 44 coding agents.

## Description
SkillKit lets you save any webpage as a reusable AI agent skill with one click. The saved SKILL.md file works instantly across 44 coding agents including Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and more.

How it works:
- Click the extension icon to save the current page as a skill
- Right-click any page and select "Save page as Skill"
- Select text, right-click, and choose "Save selection as Skill"

When you save a page, the extension sends the page URL to our server (skillkit.sh / agenstskills.com) where it is converted to clean markdown with auto-generated tags and YAML frontmatter. The resulting skill file is downloaded to your computer. No page content, browsing history, or personal data is ever sent — only the URL of the page you choose to save.

Saving selected text works entirely offline with no network requests.

After saving, run `skillkit install <path>` to make the skill available to all your AI coding agents at once.

Features:
- Converts HTML to clean markdown via server-side processing
- Auto-generates YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Smart tag detection from 50+ tech keywords (weighted 5-source analysis)
- GitHub URL support (auto-converts blob URLs to raw content)
- Context menu integration for quick saves
- Works on any webpage
- No account or API key required
